# R3Modeller
A (WIP) 3d modelling program, using OpenGL, C# and WPF/MVVM

For the record I don't plan on competing with blender or C4d lol... this is just a learning tool. I know so little about writing a performant OpenGL 
app and mesh loading/generation, so I hope to learn that by writing a 3D modelling program

I copied a bunch of boilerplate code from my other project, FramePFX, but I'm not even using 1% of it, which is why the project is so big. Most of the rendering code is in MainWindow.xaml.cs
